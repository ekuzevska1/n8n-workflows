While everyone else was promising AGI miracles, we were building custom AI agents that actually solve real problems. No coding required, no BS promises - just practical automation that saves you 15+ hours per week and stops the $2000+ monthly SaaS bleeding.\n\n**Founded by builders who've been there:** Elizabeta (25 years turning marketing chaos into revenue), John (30 years making enterprise deals happen), and Peter (turning overwhelmed entrepreneurs into confident operators). We've lived through every marketing fad and learned what actually moves the needle.\n\n## Brand Mission\n**Cut through AI hype to build custom revenue solutions that work.** We help B2B companies implement AI agents that actually solve business problems - not because it's trendy, but because it saves time and makes money.\n\n## Brand Values\n- **Results Over Rhetoric**: Working code beats marketing slides every time\n- **Anti-Hype Truth**: Call out AI BS while building practical solutions  \n- **Custom Over Cookie-Cutter**: Your business is unique, your AI should be too\n- **No-Code Empowerment**: Advanced tech without the technical barriers\n- **Transparent Value**: Show exactly what you're getting and what it costs\n\n## Brand Personality\n**The Experienced Operator** - Part skeptical veteran, part practical builder.
